This repo contains boilerplate code for a d3 viz.

To use on your project first install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

On Mac, install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), then Node from Homebrew.
On Windows, you can use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/nodejs) to install Node.

NPM, is included with node so you don't have to do anything.

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
$ npm install
```

To start developing run:

```bash
$ npm start
```

You should see a new browser tap opening and a title of "D3 Boilerplate" in http://127.0.0.1:8080.

From there, you start to develop your own code in the `app` directory. When you finish coding, use `npm run build` or `npm run deploy` to build the static files.
